# Eunora — An adaptive mood reflection app

Eunora is a mood reflection app where the experience adapts to emotional intensity, not just emotional labels.

The app is built with Kotlin Multiplatform, sharing core logic and UI across Android and iOS.

## Problem Statement

Most mood-tracking apps focus on **recording emotions**, not responding to them.  
Users log how they feel, but the experience remains the same regardless of emotional intensity or context.

In reality, different emotional states require different kinds of support.  
Positive moments may be worth preserving, intense emotions may need a pause, and low-energy moods may require rest rather than reflection.

**Eunora focuses on how the app responds**, combining gentle guidance, personal reflection, and an adaptive flow to help users better understand themselves — not just track their mood.
